    <div id="study-information" class="hidden centered">
      <p>Thank you for your participation in our research study. It is being
      conducted by members of the Chrome team at Google Inc ("Google").</p>

      <h3>Purpose of the study</h3>
      <p>We are looking to better understand how people interpret and interact
      with security warnings in Chrome.</p>

      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <p>You will be required to install a Chrome browser extension (small
      piece of software) in the Chrome browser on your home computer. The
      browser extension will detect when you've been shown a security warning
      while browsing so that we can ask you to answer some simple questions
      about your response to the warning. We would like to run the study over a
      period of four months. During this time, we do not expect you to change
      your normal web browsing behavior. The number of surveys that you are
      shown will depend on how often you encounter security warnings during
      your normal browsing. Google may update the extension from time to time
      to change the available survey questions. We expect that each survey will
      take 2-3 minutes to complete. Upon conclusion of the study, we will
      remove the extension from your computer.</p>

      <h3>Potential Risks</h3>
      <p>Each browser extension will contain an anonymous identifier to enable
      us to group survey responses from a single participant. If you provide
      identifying information in response to any of the survey questions, then
      Google may know personal information about you and will be able to
      associate it with your other responses in the study. You should only
      provide information that you are comfortable sharing with Google.
      Otherwise, there are no special risks associated with the study beyond
      the risks posed by normal internet usage.</p>

      <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>All information provided during the study will remain confidential
      within Google. All logged data will be stored on a secure Google server
      accessible only to the researchers involved in this study. Any
      information that is obtained in connection with this study and could
      identify you will remain confidential within Google. Google may, however,
      publish the results of this study along with data collected from the
      study in an aggregated, anonymized form.</p>

      <h3>Data Use</h3>
      <p>The survey responses that you provide to Google will be used to
      improve Google's products and services.</p>

      <h3>Participation and Withdrawal</h3>
      <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary and you may
      withdraw at any time. You may remove the study extension at any time by
      following these instructions. Any survey responses that you have already
      submitted will continue to be part of the study data.</p>

      <h3>Identification of Investigators</h3>
      <p>If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel
      free to contact:<br>Rob Reeder, chrome-experience-sampling@google.com.</p>
